     [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)]
   </summary>
        Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.
      In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.
      You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

     [Data Visualization]
   </summary>
        Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.
      In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.

     [Relational Database]
   </summary>
        For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.
      These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.
      Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.
      Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

    [Back End Development and APIs]
  </summary>
      Until this point, you've only used JavaScript on the front end to add interactivity to a page, solve algorithm challenges, or build an SPA. But JavaScript can also be used on the back end, or server, to build entire web applications.
    Today, one of the popular ways to build applications is through microservices, which are small, modular applications that work together to form a larger whole.
    In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm. You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.

    [Quality Assurance]
  </summary>
      As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality.
    In the Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to.
    Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express concepts. You'll also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and connected clients.

    [Data Analysis with Python]
  </summary>
      Data Analysis has been around for a long time.
    But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau.
    But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.
    In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python.
    By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.
